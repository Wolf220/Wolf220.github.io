            <p>
                This isn't based on a template! I built this site from scratch, using simple ratrher simple HTML. if you want to take a look, the source code is on <a href='https://github.com/Wolf220/Wolf220.github.io'>my github.</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Ok, but who are you?</h2>
            <p>Fair question. I'd rather not give my real name, so I go by Wolf220. I know, I know, a dumb username, but it's one I go by almost eveywhere. Some more generic details can be found on the bar to the left. I'm working on refining my coding skills, and decided to make this website to do so, and to document my progress. Every page I make on here will be hand-typed, and everything I write about will be as open source as I can make it.</p>
